# PilotsSeat
A game about maintaining a little spaceship.

An endless game in which you take command of a small spacecraft. Your only method of input is entering codes to a command line to run different "programs", which can report the ship's status, land and take off from surfaces, eject you out, and more.
There isn't really a goal, yet. Just take care of your ship however long you want to.

I was going to make this on a TI-83+ calculator, but Python proved to be better and faster.
I'm trying to make the code easily modifiable and understandable, but it's probably gonna be a rat's nest.

My journey of coding this will definitely be a learning experience, and I hope that it will be a good game in the end!

# This project has been revived!
I last worked on this in March of 2021. It's been forever since I've last seen this code, and I am so glad that I bothered to comment this code. My ability to program Python has gotten rusty in recent times, so this code I wrote a year and a half ago might help me get back on my feet.
It is now November 2022, and I wanna finish this code.
